    "careTips": "Water deeply and consistently, providing 1-2 inches per week - critical during fruit development to prevent cracking and hollow heart. Full sun essential (8+ hours daily); needs long, hot growing season. Fertilize at planting with balanced fertilizer, then switch to a low-nitrogen, high-potassium formula when vines begin to flower. Give vines plenty of room to sprawl (6-10 feet in each direction) or train on a strong trellis with sling support for fruit. Ripe when the tendril nearest the fruit turns brown and dry, and the ground spot turns creamy yellow. Mulch heavily with straw to suppress weeds and keep fruit off wet soil. Non-toxic to pets."

    "careTips": "Water moderately, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings - borage is fairly drought tolerant once established. Full sun to partial shade (6+ hours daily). Fertilizing is generally unnecessary; borage thrives in poor to average soil and excess nitrogen produces leggy growth with fewer flowers. Sow seeds directly outdoors as borage has a long taproot and resents transplanting. Self-seeds prolifically - deadhead to control spread, or allow it to naturalize.
